# Home-Automation-Android

Every electrical appliance has its own control switch using which a person can turn ON or OFF the appliance. If the user could conveniently control several electrical appliances by just sitting at one place, whenever needed, under certain circumstances, it would bring a lot of convenience. The target is to control a light emitting device (LED) remotely. The SmartPhone applicationâ€™s interface will enable the user to control that device using Bluetooth.A serial Bluetooth module(HC-05) is used to create a connection between Arduino Uno and an Android app.The SmartPhone part will have an interface through which we would be able to switch ON/OFF the light or LED remotely. The electronics part will consist of a chip to which an LED will be connected. Once the user presses ON button on the SmartPhone handset, the LED will glow. Otherwise, if the user presses OFF, the LED will go off, thus providing Automation of things.
